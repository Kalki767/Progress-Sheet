# Problem: Word search - https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/

    def exist(self, board: List[List[str]], word: str) -> bool:
        '''Approach: BackTracking. The problem asks to check whether or not
        the given word exists in the given board. To check if it exists we use
        backtracking. We check if we can generate the word starting from every
        index and if we manage to do that we return True. The backtracking works
        by checking if the current path is the correct path we check for the
        four directions for the next element and if one of them are true then
        we continue through that path otherwise we go back and we pop the current
        row and column from the visited so if one of the calls  to backtrack
        return true it means we have found the word.'''
